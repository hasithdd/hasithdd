## About Me

I'm an AI/ML Engineer from Sri Lanka ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡° with a strong foundation in **Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science**. I'm currently pursuing dual degrees in **Applied Mathematics, Statistics & CS** (University of Colombo) and **Computer Science** (Informatics Institute of Technology).

My passion is building and deploying **agentic systems** and **intelligent voice AI**. I have hands-on experience in optimizing and deploying real-time, low-latency models on **NVIDIA Jetson** devices, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, high-performance applications.

## ðŸ”¬ Core Technical Skills

-   **Agentic AI**: LangChain, LangGraph, RAGs, Vector Databases
-   **Voice AI**: Real-time Voice Pipelines, LiveKit, OpenAI SDK, TTS
-   **Edge AI**: **NVIDIA Jetson** (Nano, Xavier, Orin), **TensorRT**, ONNX
-   **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face, FastAPI
-   **MLOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions

## ðŸš€ Professional Highlights

**Trainee AI Engineer @ Vega Innovations**
-   Designed and deployed an end-to-end **voice agent pipeline** for the **Unitree GO2 robot** on NVIDIA Jetson, enabling real-time, context-aware RAG dialogues.
-   Optimized a **real-time face recognition** model (30 FPS) and implemented custom voice ID with wake-up mechanisms for robust human-robot interaction.
-   Researched and implemented Edge AI optimizations for a vehicle recognition system (VelloPass), containerizing the full pipeline with Docker for a scalable CI/CD workflow.
