# Hasith V. Dharmarathna

AI/ML Engineer specializing in Generative AI, Voice Agents, and Edge AI.

## About Me

I am an AI/ML Engineer from Sri Lanka with a strong academic foundation in **Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science**. I am currently pursuing dual degrees in **Applied Mathematics, Statistics & CS** (University of Colombo) and **Computer Science** (Informatics Institute of Technology).

My focus is on building and deploying high-performance, low-latency models. I have hands-on experience in developing **agentic systems**, **intelligent voice AI**, and optimizing models for deployment on **NVIDIA Jetson** devices.

## Core Technical Skills

* **Agentic AI**: LangChain, LangGraph, RAGs, Vector Databases
* **Voice AI**: Real-time Voice Pipelines, LiveKit, OpenAI SDK, TTS
* **Edge AI**: NVIDIA Jetson (Nano, Xavier, Orin), TensorRT, ONNX
* **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face, FastAPI
* **MLOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions

## Professional Highlights

**Trainee AI Engineer @ Vega Innovations**

* Designed and deployed an end-to-end **voice agent pipeline** for the **Unitree GO2 robot** on NVIDIA Jetson. This system features real-time, context-aware dialogue using RAG.
* Implemented and optimized real-time **face recognition** (running at 30 FPS) and developed a custom voice ID system with wake-up mechanisms for robust human-robot interaction.
* Researched and implemented Edge AI optimizations for a vehicle recognition system (VelloPass), containerizing the full pipeline with Docker for a scalable CI/CD workflow.

## Certifications
